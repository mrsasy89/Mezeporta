# Mezeporta SteamOS

Mezeporta is a Monster Hunter Frontier launcher for Erupe community servers,
supporting 19 versions across all game branches. This fork focuses on running
the launcher and Windows game client on SteamOS through Proton and Distrobox.

It is based on [LilButter/Mezeporta](https://github.com/LilButter/Mezeporta).
Active SteamOS development is maintained on the `steamos-dev` branch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Desktop Mode login and game launch have been verified on SteamOS with Proton
> Experimental. Gaming Mode currently reaches game launch, but a black-screen
> issue under Gamescope is still being investigated. Full Gaming Mode support
> is not yet considered complete.

See [Docs/SteamOS.md](Docs/SteamOS.md) for the implementation notes and
validation plan.

## How to run

> [!NOTE]
> Game Dlls must be [unpacked](#unpacking-dlls) for the launcher to work.

Windows and Linux: place the launcher files in the game directory beside the
`dat` folder.

Your folder should look like this:

Windows:
```text
GameFolder/
  /dat
  Mezeporta.exe
  mhf.ini
  mhfo.dll
  xinput1_3.dll
```

Or Linux:
```text
GameFolder/
  /dat
  /Mezeporta
  mezeporta-bin
  run-mezeporta.sh
  mhf.ini
  mhfo.dll
  xinput1_3.dll
```

On Linux, make the launcher script and binary executable:
```bash
chmod +x run-mezeporta.sh mezeporta-bin
```

Launch command:
```bash
./run-mezeporta.sh
```

_FOR S7K version move ALL files from the provided folder into the game directory with the launcher._

### SteamOS Desktop Mode

The currently verified development workflow runs the Linux launcher inside an
Arch Distrobox while Proton Experimental runs on the SteamOS host:

```bash
export MEZEPORTA_PROTON_CMD="$PWD/scripts/linux/proton-host-debug.sh"
export MEZEPORTA_HOST_PROTON="$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton - Experimental/proton"

npm run tauri:dev -- \
  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
  --config src-tauri/tauri.linux.conf.json
```

In **Settings**, select the game directory and set **Wine Prefix Mode** to
**Proton**. Proton compat data is stored at
`<game>/Mezeporta/ProtonData`; Proton owns its `pfx` child.

To build the portable package after a successful release build:

```bash
npm run tauri:build:linux:portable
```

The package is created under:

```text
src-tauri/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/bundle/portable/
```

Gaming Mode validation is ongoing. Do not treat the current launcher script as
a finished release integration until the Gamescope black-screen issue and land
transition have both been verified.

## Server Wrapper (Server Owners)
> [!NOTE]
> This is now OPTIONAL and you may connect to Erupe servers normally using the SignV1 option.

The [Wrapper](https://github.com/LilButter/Mezeporta-Wrapper) is a separate helper for Erupe servers and is required for the API server features to work.

(e.g. Mail, Distribution, Character Book, and Events)

## Custom Images

Server Owners can provide the launcher with their own identity and artwork:
- Banners
- Headers
- Backgrounds
- ServerTag
- Cog
- Capcom
- Links
- Announcements
- News
- Server-patch
- Dialogue

Hunters can also provide their own images by enabling Offline-Images and placing the images in Mezeporta/Offline-Images/

(News, Announcements, Links, ServerTag and Banners are still provided by the server while Offline-Images are enabled.)

## Character Book
![Character book](Docs/Assets/BookFeature.png)

Character Book uses cached character savedata to provide equipment w/deco, currency, courses, itembox and playtime for the selected character.

Savedata cache is fetched at login and is cleared once the game starts. Savedata re-fetches only if cleared.

## Mail
![Mail viewer](Docs/Assets/MailFeature.png)

Mail shows player messages, system messages, guild invites, sender, dates, and item attachments.

## Distributions
![Distribution viewer](Docs/Assets/DistroFeature.png)

Distributions show unclaimed rewards with title, description, type, deadlines, color-coded text, item icons, and reward details.

## Friends List

| Small List | Large List |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="Docs/Assets/FriendsSmallFeature.png" alt="Small friends list"> | <img src="Docs/Assets/FriendsMaxFeature.png" alt="Large friends list"> |

Friends list contains your friends for the selected character also providing an online/offline icon. The pop-up changes dynamically with the amount of friends you have. MAX 50 :)

## Events
![Event information](Docs/Assets/EventFeature.png)

Active event buttons can appear in the footer area with their own information panels.
- MezFes
- Hunter Festa

- Hunting Tournament

## Settings

| Description open | Description closed |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="Docs/Assets/SettingsFeature1.png" alt="Settings page"> | <img src="Docs/Assets/SettingsFeature2.png" alt="Linux settings page"> |

The Settings page provides options ranging from launcher specific settings like launcher resolution or font, all the way to advanced graphics, audio, wine-prefix, and more.

## Patching

Mezeporta has multi-server patch support!
- Checks the selected server for patch information.
- Compares patch data against the selected client folder and checks cached patches to reuse if the e-tag/manifest matches.
- Renames any original files to have the extension .mezeold (if previously patched, it will restore to original files first before applying the new patch)
- Downloads missing or outdated files provided by the wrapper.
- Caches patch files under Mezeporta/Servers

## Unpacking Dlls

To unpack the dlls use [OllyDbg](https://ollydbg.net/download.htm)

You will also need the [CodeDoctor](https://github.com/JackAston/OllyDbg1plugins/tree/master/CodeDoctor%20v0.90) plugin.
- Step 1: Move `CodeDoctor.dll` and `CodeDoctor.ini` into `OllyDbg/Plugins` folder.
- Step 2: Open OllyDbg and load the game dll.
- Step 3: Navigate to `Plugins` then `CodeDoctor` and select `Unpack AsProtect`.
- Step 4: Move the unpacked dll into the game folder.
- Step 5: Happy Hunting!


## Windows Development

Requirements:

- Node.js and npm.
- Rustup.

Setup:

```powershell
npm install
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

Dev mode for styling/Frontend:

```powershell
npm run tauri:dev
```

Build:

```powershell
npm run tauri:build
```

## WSL Linux Development

WSL can be used from Windows to test or build the Linux launcher.

Linux and WSL builds need `src-tauri/bin/meze-deps.exe` because the Linux
launcher starts the Windows game client through Wine or Proton. A precompiled
32-bit Windows GUI helper is included.

From Windows:

```powershell
npm install
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
npm run meze-deps:build
```

Inside WSL, install and verify Linux build dependencies:

```bash
npm install
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-ubuntu.sh --install
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-ubuntu.sh --verify
```

Run through WSL:

```powershell
npm run tauri:dev:linux:wsl
```

Run through WSL with the GPU helper for hardware acceleration:

```powershell
npm run tauri:dev:linux:wsl-gpu
```

Build through WSL:

```powershell
npm run tauri:build:linux:wsl
```

Build Tarball for linux through WSL:
```bash
npm run tauri:build:linux:portable:wsl
```

Optional WSL variables:

- `MEZEPORTA_WSL_DISTRO`: WSL distro name.
- `MEZEPORTA_WSL_GPU_ADAPTER`: GPU adapter name used by the WSL GPU helper.

## Native Linux Development

Requirements:

- Node.js and npm.
- Rustup.
- WebKitGTK and JavaScriptCoreGTK development packages.
- GStreamer packages for UI audio.
- The included 32-bit Windows helper at `src-tauri/bin/meze-deps.exe`.

Ubuntu-based systems:

```bash
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-ubuntu.sh --install
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-ubuntu.sh --verify
```

Arch-based systems:

```bash
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-arch.sh --install
./scripts/linux/install-build-deps-arch.sh --verify
```

Dev mode for styling/Frontend:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev:linux
```

Build for AppImage and Deb:

```bash
npm run tauri:build:linux
```
Build Tarball for linux:
```bash
npm run tauri:build:linux:portable
```

The full Linux build attempts to create AppImage and Debian packages before
creating the portable archive. If AppImage bundling is unavailable on the
current system but the release binary compiled successfully, the portable-only
command can still package that release binary.
